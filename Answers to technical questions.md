Cucumber BDD Framework With Selenium WebDriver

Q1. How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
Answer:
I spent approximately 3-4 hours on this assessment. Its easy to get the basics running but most time consuming part is structuring the framework. If I had more time, I would have implemented the logging of each step which would have enabled me to create the extent report more proficiently.  I would have also better efficiently structured the framework and implement Jenkins.

Q2. What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
Answer:
Automation has various tools that are always advancing with upgrades/new version and as well as new technologies. I really find it interesting that in an agile world how businesses are inclined to try new Automation solutions; Codeless Test Automation by TestingWhiz is an example. Testing, on the other hand, is slowly conversing to higher automation to ensure best accuracy and precision in the drive towards digital transformation, we are moving towards a situation where machines will be gradually assuming control. 

Q3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
Answer:
Though I have not implemented automation for a legacy application but if I had to, I would recommend a risk based approach. Testing is primarily about information and risk and not about coverage or completeness. Some questions that would help evaluate areas to focus on would include:
•	Where is the client currently experiencing the poorest quality?
•	What are the key areas of functionality (e.g. what makes them money)?
•	Would the client prefer more features to better quality?
•	What are the biggest risks to their systems?
•	If the client could improve one thing what would it be?
Legacy software needs a custom testing strategy. For new systems we write automated tests while we are solving the problem at hand. We have the context and focus necessary to write relevant tests. On the other hand, testing legacy systems should be approached from the outside in.

Q4. How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
Answer: 
It's difficult, if not impossible, to design generically for all disabilities. Upon automating Just-Eat, I noticed the website has minimal to zero accessibility coverage for people who may have disabilities. Some improvements can include: using alt tags for when hovering over with your mouse, utilize color control for colorblind users or even include an accessibility guide to name a few improvements.
